# Nexus Hyperion Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Nexus Hyperion is designed with a modular architecture that allows for scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The system is built on a multi-dimensional neural network framework that integrates various components for financial and resource management across civilizations.

## High-Level Architecture

The architecture of Nexus Hyperion can be divided into the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: 
   - User interfaces for interaction with the system.
   - Web-based dashboards and command-line interfaces.

2. **Application Layer**: 
   - Core application logic that processes user requests and manages workflows.
   - Contains modules for risk assessment, currency exchange, resource optimization, cognitive advisors, and ethical governance.

3. **Data Layer**: 
   - Manages data storage and retrieval.
   - Utilizes databases for structured data and distributed ledgers for transaction records.

4. **Integration Layer**: 
   - Interfaces with external systems and APIs for data exchange.
   - Supports intergalactic currency exchange and real-time data feeds.
